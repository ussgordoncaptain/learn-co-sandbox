Has many/belongs to relation 

cats has column owner_id this is called a BELONGS TO realtionship 

1 Owner HAS MANY cats 

Join table 
Starting from the 2 tables above 
CREATE TABLE cats_owners (
cat_id INTEGER,
owner_id INTEGER
);

Now insert values that define each relationship

INERT INTO cats_owners 
(cat_id, owner_id) VALUES 
(3,2) 

INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (3, 3); 

From here we can use INNER JOIN to get the names of the cats (or other arbitrary data)
